# UdacityRLProject1

This is the 1st project for the Udacity Deep Reinforecement Learning class.

The goal of this project is to train a neural network to output next actions given states that will navigate through an environment picking up yellow bananas for one point and avoiding picking up purple bananas which subtract a goal point.  The agent has 300 steps to reach a goal of gaining 13 points.

# Setup
Setup UnityML environment dependencies.
Intall python library dependencies listed in the the requirements.txt file.

# Reviewing Results and Code
Code for training and reviewing model output is in the Report.ipynb file
Model weights are stored in the checkpoint.pth file
